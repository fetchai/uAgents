# This workflow is triggered when a PR is merged whose source branch's name starts with "release" and whose target branch is "main".
# It checks for the current package version (in pyproject.toml) and the latest tag on GitHub.
# If package version is more recent, it builds the project, uploads to PYPI, creates a Tag and makes a release on GitHub.
# Secrets PYPI_USERNAME and PYPI_PASSWORD are required!
