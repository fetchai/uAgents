## Setup and Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/mdabucse/Medical-Agent-FETCH-AI-.git
    cd <AI AGENT>
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
    Make sure you have Python installed. Install the required packages using pip:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirments.txt
    ```

3. **Set Environment Variables**:
    You need to set your OpenAI API key as an environment variable. You can do this in your terminal:
    ```bash
    export OPENAI_API_KEY='your_openai_api_key'
    ```

4. **Run the Agent**:
    Execute the following command to run the MedIQ agent:
    ```bash
    python Main.py
    ```

## Usage

1. **Initialize the Agent**:
    The agent is initialized with a predefined seed phrase. The address of the agent will be printed on the console.
    ```python
    SEED_PHRASE = "MED IQ"
    print(f'My Agent Address Is {Agent(seed=SEED_PHRASE).address}')
    ```

2. **Funding the Agent**:
    Ensure the agent's wallet is funded to interact with the network.
    ```python
    fund_agent_if_low(MedIQ.wallet.address())
    ```

3. **Define the Protocol**:
    A protocol named `MedIQProtocol` is defined to handle messages.
    ```python
    MedIQProtocol = Protocol("MEDIQ Protocol")
    ```

4. **Interacting with the Agent**:
    Users can send a message to the agent by specifying the medicine name. The agent processes the request and provides detailed information about the medicine.

## Code Explanation

- **Models**:
    - `Medi`: A model to capture the medicine name provided by the user.

- **Agent Initialization**:
    - The agent is initialized using a seed phrase and is associated with a unique mailbox key.

- **OpenAI Integration**:
    - The `output` function sends a prompt to OpenAI's API to fetch detailed information about the medicine.

- **Message Handling**:
    - The `load_model` function handles incoming messages, processes the prompt, fetches the response from OpenAI, and sends the information back to the user.

## Example Interaction

When a user sends a message with the medicine name, the agent responds with detailed information formatted as follows:
