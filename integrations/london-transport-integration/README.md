# uAgent London Transport Examples 

This repository contains examples of london transport journey planner integrations using three agents: `tfl_agent` and `user_agent`.

1. `user_agent` : This agent takes from and to location request as details from user, and responds with all possible routes with detailed plan.

2. `tfl_agent`: This agent takes from and to location from user, fetches the post code using [UK PostCode API](https://rapidapi.com/search/uk%2Bpostcodes) and sends request to tfl request link with journey endpoint. https://api.tfl.gov.uk/Journey/JourneyResults/from_loc/to/to_loc. This sends all possible routes to the user agent.
