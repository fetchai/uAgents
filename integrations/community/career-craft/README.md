## Abstract

Introducing a comprehensive job search tool powered by Fetch AI's uAgents. This innovative solution customises job recommendations based on your resume, helps create tailored resumes, analyses job descriptions for compatibility with your profile, and automates cold emailing with follow-up features. It revolutionises the job search process, offering personalised efficiency and seamless integration.

## Assumptions

1. It is assumed that each proposed Uagent is already deployed within the Fetch network.
2. At present, the sequence of actions among agents is pre-established. It is anticipated that DeltaV will furnish the capability to determine the most optimal arrangement of agents to effectively address the user query.
3. The selection of agents for our project aligns with the vision outlined by FetchAI.
