## Agents Used in our Project

** Travel Advisor Agent **

   The Travel Advisor Agent provides personalized travel recommendations for users based on their destination preferences. It leverages the RapidAPI Maps Data API to gather information about various places to visit in the specified location.


   ## Usage
      Once the agent is up and running, users can interact with it by sending a message with the name of the destination they want to visit. The agent will respond with a list of recommended places to visit in that location.

   ## Example
      Here's an example of how to interact with the Travel Advisor Agent:

         |                                                  |
         |  User: What are some places to visit in Paris?   |
         |   Agent:                                         |
