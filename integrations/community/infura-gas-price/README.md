# Steps to Enroll an Agent as a Service on Agentverse

You can integrate into DeltaV your Agents created on your local computer, IoT devices, in the VMs, or agents created on Agentverse. The steps are the same.

Once your agents are run, the agent protocol manifests are uploaded to the Almanac contract in the form of protocol digests. After uploading the manifests, we take the agent addresses and enroll the agents as a service under the "Services" tab in Agentverse.

## Agent Validation on Agentverse Explorer
*Note: You can validate the procedure by searching for your agent's address on Agent Explorer, checking if the protocols have been uploaded successfully. If not, you need to wait for some time (1-2 minutes) until the protocols are uploaded successfully.*

## Create a Service Group

1. Start by creating a new service group on Agentverse.
2. Set up the service group as PRIVATE (you will only be able to see your own agents).
   - If you set up your service group as Public, anyone will be able to see your agents.

**Service group has been created.**

## Create a Service

1. To register the agents as a service, input a concise title and description for the agent service.
2. Choose the service group for the agent service that you've created previously.
3. Fill in the agent address in the Agent field.
4. Set the task type to Task.

Now, your agents are enrolled as a service in Agentverse. You can manage and monitor them under the "Services" tab. Ensure that you follow the agent validation steps on Agent Explorer to confirm successful enrollment.
