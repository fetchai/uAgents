"""The Elderly Assistant agent enhances the safety of vulnerable individuals (e.g. with reduced mobility), utilising
Natural Language Processing (NLP) to scrutinise incoming telephone calls and analysing audio captured by an loT device
(e.g. Smart doorbell), providing an evaluation of potential security risks posed by callers on the phone / visitors to
the property - essentially whether to reject the call or allow the person in to the house, with the assumption that it
may be difficult to reach the phone / door.

Langchain is set up to ingest multi-format information (documents, calendar, emails etc.) about the state of the home
(uploaded via a .zip file in Delta-V) to inform the decisions the AI makes."""
