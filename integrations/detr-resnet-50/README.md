# Fetch.AI Agent for API Integration

 
This repository contains code for a Fetch.AI agent that utilizes APIs for two different purposes: image captioning using vit-gpt2-image-captioning and object detection using facebook/detr-resnet-50. This agent is designed to interact with these APIs and perform tasks based on their outputs.

# Introduction
Fetch.AI is a decentralized network that enables devices to interact with digital representatives of real-world entities. This repository focuses on creating a Fetch.AI agent capable of utilizing external APIs to perform tasks related to image captioning and object detection.

# Features
API Integration: Utilizes external APIs for image captioning and object detection.
Fetch.AI Agent: Implements an agent that can interact with the Fetch.AI network.
Modular Design: Codebase is designed to be modular and easily extendable for future integration with additional APIs or functionalities.

# Requirements
*   Python 3.x
*   Fetch.AI Python SDK
*   `vit-gpt2-image-captioning` API
*   `facebook/detr-resnet-50` API

# Installation

1. Clone the repository:

  `git clone https://github.com/your-username/fetch-ai-api-agents.git`

2. Install dependencies:

  `pip install -r requirements.txt`

# Usage
*   Set up your Fetch.AI environment and configure your agent accordingly.
    
*   Obtain API keys or access tokens for `vit-gpt2-image-captioning` and `facebook/detr-resnet-50`.
    
*   Modify the agent configurations to include your API keys and tokens.
    
*   Run the agent:
    `agent.py`
    
*   Monitor agent behavior and interactions with the Fetch.AI network.
