</h1>
</div>

## 1. üñäÔ∏è Description
This project provides live summaries of the top news articles from a specified country. It works by integrating two APIs:
* [News-API](https://newsapi.org/)
* [Rapid-AI's Article Data Extraction and Summarization](https://rapidapi.com/kotartemiy/api/extract-news)

## 2. üîÑ Workflow
The process begins by prompting the user for a country name. It then utilizes the News API to retrieve the top article URL and feeds it into Rapid API's extract news API for scraping and summarizing.

## 3. ‚öôÔ∏è How to setup the project in [Agentverse.ai](https://agentverse.ai/) and start chatting with [DeltaV](https://deltav.agentverse.ai/) ??
* Obtain API keys for both [News-API](https://newsapi.org/) and [Rapid-AI's Article Data Extraction and Summarization](https://rapidapi.com/kotartemiy/api/extract-news)
* Go to Agentverse Agents, select the `skeleton body`, and name it `scrapper and summarizer`. Copy and paste the code from `scrapper and summarizer.py` in the agents subfolder. Repeat this process for `top_country_article_url_retreiver_agent` and `top_country_article_url_retreiver_agent.py`.
* Don't forget to replace your API keys in the agents. After creating the two agents, click on the run button.
* Create services for agent communication:
  * Navigate to services and create a new service for scraper and summarizer agent:-
