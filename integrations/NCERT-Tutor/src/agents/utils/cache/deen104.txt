I know a curious little boy,
Who is always asking ﬁWhy?ﬂ

Why this, why that, why then, why now?

Why not, why by-the-by?
He wants to know why wood should swim,
Why lead and marble sink,

Why sun should shine and wind should blow

And why we eat and drink.
He wants to know what makes the clouds
And why they cross the sky,

Why sinks the sun behind the hills

And why the flowers die.
Some of these why™s are not too hard
To answer if you™ll try;

Others no one ever yet

Has found the reason why.

Let™s sing
I met a man in an onion bed.
He was crying so hard his eyes were red.

And the tears rolled off the end of his nose

As he ate his way down the onion r
ows.
He ate and he cried, but for all his tears

He sang, ﬁSweet onions, oh my dears!

I love you, I do and you love me,

But you make me as sad as a man can be.ﬂ

One day, Alice was lying under a tree listening to her
sister reading a story.
Suddenly, she saw a white rabbit scamper by. He
had pink eyes and was wearing a blue coat. He took

out a big watch from his waistcoat pocket and as he

hurried away, he said, ﬁOh dear, I will be too late!ﬂ
She thought there was something very differ
ent
about this rabbit. It could talk, it wor
e a red
waistcoat and it carried a watch.

Alice wondered, ﬁA talking

rabbit? A rabbit who wears a

waistcoat!ﬂ Alice was burning with

curiosity and she followed the

white rabbit.

The rabbit started running and Alice followed the
rabbit. The rabbit suddenly popped down a large
rabbit hole. Alice jumped into the rabbit hole too! The

rabbit went down and down and down and down into

the rabbit hole.
Alice said aloud, ﬁWhere am
I? How many miles down

have I fallen? I must be

getting somewhere

near the centre of

the earth.ﬂ She

wondered, ﬁW
ill I slip
thr
ough the earth to
the other side?ﬂ
! Alice landed
on a pile of dry leaves.

She  looked around

quickly and suddenly saw

the white rabbit again. It

disappeared saying, ﬁOh, my

ears and whiskers! How late it™s

getting!ﬂ
Alice stood up and saw a small
door about fifteen inches high. It was

too small for her to go through.
She saw a glass table with a golden

key on it. She tried the
little golden key in the

lock and to her

delight it fitted!

Alice opened the

door and looked

into the loveliest

garden she had

ever seen! How

she longed to be

among those

beds of bright

flowers and those

cool fountains! But

she could not even get her head through the doorway.
ﬁOh! How I wish, I could become smaller!ﬂ she
exclaimed loudly.
