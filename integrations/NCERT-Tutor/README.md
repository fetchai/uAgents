### You can watch a video demo of our project: [demo video](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/175eGJjyQfFjJ36Qk0ACPx_CXWFQbdVnE?usp=drive_link)

## Vision of our project
- To simplify and improve learning attitude and aptitude
- To reach many students with all the help ncessary to ace thier exams
- To simplify and have the tedious tasks of memorizing and concept revision done easy with autonomous agents.

## Future scopes of your project
- To create a more conversational and seamless experience  by allowing the user to ask further questions about the chapter and get those included in the notes aswell by implementing the experimental [Dialogue module](https://github.com/Quantaindew/uAgents/blob/main/integrations/fetch-ai-engine/src/ai_engine/chitchat.py)
- To implement an additional feature that lets the user also practice questions with the help of flashcards , this will be an interactive experience   for the user to retain concepts and revise quicker .



  

## Project Information

### Abstract
Our project, NCERT Tutor, is designed to simplify the learning process by providing a personalized tutoring experience. It asks the user for their class, subject, and chapter they want to learn or have a doubt in, then fetches the corresponding chapter PDF from the NCERT website, summarizes the content, and creates notes along with important questions through a seamless interaction enabled via delta v. The agents in our project deployed on Agentverse is fully operational through Delta V.


### Agents used in our Project
- **Interact Agent**
  - The first pillar and the initiator of the entire sequence of the workflow based on the user input done through delta v.
  - Knows the preferences of the user based on previous interactions with agents
  - Aims to maximize the educational value of the user while also providing the best options towards user query
``question.py``
- **NCERT Content Fetcher** (locally via mailbox)
  - The second pillar runs locally by utilising fetch ai's mailbox feature and  fetches the knowledge necessary in the form of chapter PDF from the NCERT website database based on user input if the PDF is already cached locally it uses that directly .
``ncertagent.py``
- **Content Summarizer**(locally via mailbox)
  - The third pillar  also runs locally via mailrbox . This  summarizes the fetched content to provide a concise overview.
  - This agent  also provides the user with the entire analysis of the chapter,  and provides questions bank with answer set in a pretty format via a cloudinary link which the user can use to download the file
``openai.py``
- **Conclusive agent**
  - The final pillar of our command chain who completes the entire flow  by giving the user the final content and the link to download the notes thus concluding the pursuits of user with a fulfilling end to end  experience.
``end.py``

### Sample Flow of our NCERT Tutor
1. User inputs their class, subject, and chapter.
2. User Agent captures the input and calls the NCERT Content Fetcher to retrieve the chapter PDF.
3. NCERT Content Fetcher fetches the PDF and passes it to the Content Summarizer.
4. Content Summarizer summarizes the content  also creates the notes in a pretty format for the user and provides a dynamic sharable link to download the content and passes it to the Ending Agent.
5. Ending Agent displays the sharable link to the notes along with the content to the user thus completing the  end to end user experience .

- Agentverse
- Mailroom
- Delta v

## Getting Started

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/Quantaindew/NCERT-Tutor.git
```

2. Install the required dependencies:
```
cd NCERT-Tutor
```

3.Initialize the environment:

```
poetry install
poetry shell
```
4.Run the backend server
```
 cd src/agents/utils
 uvicorn ncert:app --reload
```
5.Running the ecosystem of the agent :



```
cd src/uagents/ncert
poetry shell
python ncertagent.py
```




###
Reminder: the openai agent requires a gpt4 api key which needs to be put into the .env file in the same directory as the agent (you will find a .env-template file)
###

```
cd src/uagents/openai
poetry shell
python openai.py 
```

```
cd src/uagents/ending
poetry shell
python end.py 
```
```
cd src/uagents/conversation
poetry shell
python question.py
```
reminder: for the conversation agent demo to run locally , you will need to uncomment the hardcoded query üëá
``` python
@agent.on_event("startup")
async def startup(ctx: Context):
    ctx.logger.info("Question System Agent Started")
    ctx.logger.info(f"{agent.address}")

    ##Local Testing code snippet, uncomment the code below to run locally
    #intentionally added typo to test levenshtien distance algorithm
    chapter_name = "alice in wonland"
    chapter_num = find_chapter_number(chapter_name)
    standard = 4
    ctx.logger.info(f"Chapter Name : {chapter_name}, Chapter number: {chapter_num}, standard: {standard}")
    
    #await ctx.send("agent1qvwqu6a0km09mq4f6j6kmke9smswmgcergmml9a54av9449rqtmmxy4qwe6", Question(question = f"Can you provide a summary of the chapter {chapter_name} from standard {standard} English?", chapter = chapter_num, subject = "english", standard = standard, sender = agent.address))
 
  # uncomment this ‚òùÔ∏è query to run the demo locally.

```




Run the above commands in order in different terminals
