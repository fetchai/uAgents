# LangChain RAG integration

LangChain RAG integration example offers a guide to setting up and using RAG (retrieval augmented generation) technology in a uagent. This example shows how to create a RAG application that can answer question based on a document.

- Python (v3.10+ recommended)
- Poetry (A Python packaging and dependency management tool)

## Setup

1. For the demo to work, you need to get some API keys:

    - Visit the [Cohere website](https://dashboard.cohere.com/).
    - Sign up or log in.
    - Navigate to `API Keys`.
    - Copy an existing key or create a new one.

    - Visit the [OpenAI website](https://openai.com/).
    - Sign up or log in.
    - Navigate to the API section to obtain your API key.

    Note that if youâ€™ve run out of OpenAI credits, you will not be able to get results for this example.

2. In the `langchain-rag/src` directory, create a `.env` file and set your API keys and the agent seed:

    ```
    export COHERE_API_KEY="{GET THE API KEY}"
    export OPENAI_API_KEY="{GET THE API KEY}"
    export LANGCHAIN_RAG_SEED="{random string that determines your agent's address}"
    ```

3. In the `langchain-rag` directory install all dependencies

    ```bash
    poetry install
    ```

3. To load the environment variables from `.env:

    ```bash
    cd src
    source .env
    ```

## Running The Main Script

To run the project, use the command:

```
poetry run python main.py
```


After running the command, a request is sent to the agent in every minute. The results can be seen in the console. Look for the following output in the logs:

```
Adding RAG agent to Bureau: {agent_address}
```

Copy the {agent_address} value and replace RAG_AGENT_ADDRESS with this value in src/langchain_rag_user.py.

In the src/langchain_rag_user.py file, there are variables QUESTION, URL, DEEP_READ. Change the value of these variables to customize the question you want to get answered. Default values are:

```
QUESTION = "How to install uagents using pip"
URL = "https://fetch.ai/docs/guides/agents/installing-uagent"
DEEP_READ = "no"  # it means nested pages at the URL won't be parsed, just the actual URL
```

Now you can enjoy answering questions with LangChain RAG agent!
