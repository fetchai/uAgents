#  Multi-Agent adapter system

This Multi-Agent adapter architecture can be useful when you have many agents and you would like to send messages to all of them, then would like to wait and collect all the responses from all of them, and send back a final result/options at once to DeltaV.

### Step 1:
Create a Blank Agent on Agentverse:
https://fetch.ai/docs/guides/agentverse/creating-a-hosted-agent
Click on the newly created blank agent and paste content of the `src/agents/ai_agent.py` into the editor.
The name of the agent can be for example `AI Agent`.

### Step 2:
Run your AI Agent by clicking on `Run`:
https://fetch.ai/docs/guides/agentverse/creating-a-hosted-agent#create-your-first-hosted-agent-on-the-agentverse

### Step 3 (optional):
You can repeat step 1 and 2 to create many AI Agents.

### Step 4:
Create another Blank Agent on Agentverse:
https://fetch.ai/docs/guides/agentverse/creating-a-hosted-agent
Click on the newly created blank agent and paste content of the `src/agents/adapter.py` into the editor.
The name of the agent can be for example `AI Agents Adapter`.

### Step 5:
On line 14 add your AI Agent address(es):

    ```python
    ctx.storage.set("ai_agent_addresses", "{YOUR_AI_AGENT_ADDRESS(ES) AS A LIST OF STRINGS}")
    ```

### Step 6:
Run your AI Agents adapter by clicking on `Run`:
https://fetch.ai/docs/guides/agentverse/creating-a-hosted-agent#create-your-first-hosted-agent-on-the-agentverse

### Step 7:
Register your newly created AI Agents Adapter as a Service on Agentverse:
https://fetch.ai/docs/guides/agentverse/registering-agent-services
Name of the service can be for example `AI Agents adapter`.
Description: `AI Agents adapter that sends prompt to multiple AI Agents and collects responses from them.`
`prompt` field description: `The prompt the user wants the AI Agents to generate response for. You must ask the user what the prompt is, don't pre fill it.`

### Step 8:
Go to DeltaV (https://fetch.ai/docs/guides/deltav/deltav-chat-interface)
and specify an objective similar to this: `Generate text with multiple AI Agents`
After you select the `AI Agents adapter` option you will be asked for the prompt.
After confirming the context you should be able to seee the responses generated by all your AI Agents!
