# Contributing

Contributions to integrations are welcome ðŸ˜Š the integrations repo is the place where you can share how you've integrated uAgents with other technology.

## A few simple rules

- Search the repo for the integration you're submitting, just in case.

- run [black](https://pypi.org/project/black/) on your code before submitting.

- Include a `project.json` file, example of:

```js
{
    "title": "Bert Base Uncased",
    "description": "BERT base model (uncased) Pretrained model on English language using a masked language modeling (MLM) objective.",
    "categories":    ["Text Classification", "Hugging Face", "Text Generation"], 
    "deltav": false
}
```

Set deltav to true if your agent is built using agentverse and is accessible by DeltaV.
