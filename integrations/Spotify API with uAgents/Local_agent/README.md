## uAgents:AI Agent Framework
 uAgents is a library developed by Fetch.ai that allows for creating autonomous AI agents in Python. Here there are two agents that communicatie with each other, one agent dispalys the menu and the other agent selects an option from the menu, then the first agent calls the API based on the search and dispalys the result.
# ðŸš€ Features
ðŸ¤– Easy creation and management: Create any type of agent you can think of and put into code.
ðŸ”— Connected: On startup, each agent automatically joins the fast growing network of uAgents by registering on the Almanac, a smart contract deployed on the Fetch.ai blockchain.
ðŸ”’ Secure: uAgent messages and wallets are cryptographically secured, so their identities and assets are protected.
