# Introduction
The **μAgents** (micro-Agents) project is a fast and lightweight framework that makes it easy to build agents for a variety of decentralized use cases.

## Why use μAgents?

They are:

- **easy to learn**: follow our quick start guides to [install](installation.md) the Python package and [create an agent](run-agent.md) in just a few minutes.
- **customizable**: create any type of agent you can think of and put into code.
- **connected**: on startup, each agent automatically joins the fast growing network of μAgents by registering on the [almanac](almanac-overview.md), a smart contract deployed on the Fetch.ai blockchain.
- **secure**: uAgent messages and wallets are crytographically secured, so their identities and assets are protected.
