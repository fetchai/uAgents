# Installation

## System requirements

!!! Info "System requirements"
    uAgents can be used on `Ubuntu/Debian`, `MacOS`, and `Windows`.
    
    You need <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/" target="_blank">Python</a> 3.8, 3.9 or 3.10 on your system.

## Install from PyPI

!!! Info "We recommend first creating a clean Python virtual environment, for example using [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/) or [pipenv](https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/install/)."
    === "poetry"
        Create and enter a new `poetry` virtual environment:
        ``` bash
        poetry init -n && poetry shell
        ```
    === "pipenv"
        Create and enter a new `pipenv` environment:
        ``` bash
        pipenv --python 3.10 && pipenv shell
        ```

Now install μAgents from the PyPI package registry:
``` bash
pip install uagents
```



??? note "Alternatively, install from source code:"

    Download the latest released version from Github and navigate to the uAgents directory

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/fetchai/uAgents.git
    cd uAgents
    ```

    Install the required dependencies

    ```
    poetry install
    ```

    Open the virtual environment

    ```
    poetry shell
    ```
