# Agent protocols

The Î¼Agents framework supports capturing related message types and handlers in **protocols**.
Agents who include the same protocol will be able to communicate with each other.

A `protocol` is built similar to an `agent`, but it has no identity and cannot be run.
It contains only the message types and handlers that define some component of agent functionality.

To show how this works, we will use a simple restaurant table booking request as an example.
We first need to define the type of messages that the handler will receive and send. 
Here we define `BookTableRequest` which will contain the requested table number and `BookTableResponse` which will inform the user if that table is available.

```python
from uagents import Context, Model, Protocol


class BookTableRequest(Model):
    table_number: int


class BookTableResponse(Model):
    success: bool

```

Now we define the booking protocol as `book_proto` and we define the desired logic to determine if the `BookTableResponse` will be successful or not.

```python
book_proto = Protocol()


@book_proto.on_message(model=BookTableRequest, replies={BookTableResponse})
async def handle_book_request(ctx: Context, sender: str, msg: BookTableRequest):
    if ctx.storage.has(str(msg.table_number)):
        success = False
    else:
        success = True
        ctx.storage.set(str(msg.table_number), sender)

    # send the response
    await ctx.send(sender, BookTableResponse(success=success))

```

We will create a folder named `protocols` and save this file in it as `book.py`. 
We can then import it from the agent script:

```python
from protocols.book import book_proto
```

Then, if your agent is called `restaurant` you can include the protocol in this way:

```python
restaurant.include(book_proto)
```
